Hi, here is  my 'DATA ANALYSIS' portfolio.


I have used various librairies of python for my 'Exploratory data analysis using python'.


My SQL project is based on queries in which i have used various 'joins' on 'music store' sample data set.

The Power BI project gives insights about the 'Attrition Rate' of an HR Department. 


My tableau project describes an analytical approach presented as dashboard based on 'Electric Vehicle' data.


Microsoft Excel analysis project is based on 'American Road Accident' in which i have used various technique's like "data cleaning, data filtering, data sorting" and finally creating an visual Dashboard.
